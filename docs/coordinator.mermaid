        - Regular health monitoring
        - Shard leader election monitoring
        - Ready for scaling operations

        Critical Phase:
        - Cluster in read-only mode
        - Atomic key movement
        - Consistency verification
        - No partial states

        Recovery Actions:
        - Rollback partial changes
        - Alert operators
        - Retry with backoff
        - Manual intervention possible
